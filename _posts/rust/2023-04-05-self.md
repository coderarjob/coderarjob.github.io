What are `self` and `Self` types in Rust?

## self

self resolves the path relative to the current module. self can only be used as the first segment, 
without a preceding ::.

```rust
fn foo() {}
fn bar() {
    self::foo();
}
fn main() {}
```

## Self

Self, with a capital "S", is used to refer to the implementing type within traits and 
implementations.

Self can only be used as the first segment, without a preceding ::.

```rust
trait T {
    type Item;
    const C: i32;
    // `Self` will be whatever type that implements `T`.
    fn new() -> Self;
    // `Self::Item` will be the type alias in the implementation.
    fn f(&self) -> Self::Item;
}
struct S;
impl T for S {
    type Item = i32;
    const C: i32 = 9;
    fn new() -> Self {           // `Self` is the type `S`.
        S
    }
    fn f(&self) -> Self::Item {  // `Self::Item` is the type `i32`.
        Self::C                  // `Self::C` is the constant value `9`.
    }
}
```
