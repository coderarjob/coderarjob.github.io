title: Rust notes - Object Oriented Programming in Rust?
categories: rust
---

Rust supports a different flavour of Object Oriented Programming. One of the way rust is very
different is that it does not support polymorphism through _inheritance_. The following code
gives an example.

```rust

trait Living {
    fn can_move(&self) -> bool;
}

// Animal has an implementation of the Living trait.
struct Animal;

impl Living for Animal {
    fn can_move(&self) -> bool {
        true
    }
}

// Plant has another implementation of the Living trait.
struct Plant;

impl Living for Plant {
    fn can_move(&self) -> bool {
        false
    }
}

fn main() {
    // This shows the two ways by which the corresponding implementaion can be called.
    let a = Animal;
    let p = Plant;

    // Using the dot notation.
    println! ("Animal: {:>6}\nPlant : {:>6}", 
             a.can_move(), 
             p.can_move());

    // Because the `can_move` is a method with `&self` parameter, the following can also be done.
    // Suitable implementation will be called.    
    println! ("Animal: {:>6}\nPlant : {:>6}",
             Living::can_move(&a),
             Living::can_move(&p));

    // However, note this is not the case similar to inheritance in OO. The following will not
    // compile.
    let a: Living = Animal;     // Error. Size is not known at compile time.
}
```

In the above case, we saw that `let a: Living = Animal;`, is not valid statement. The intension of
such a statement is similar to how inheritance - We want variable `a` to accept any type which
implements `Living` trait.

One solution is to use `trait objects`. 

Trait objects are the closest thing to inheritance in rust. It can be used to to represent any type
which has a implementation for the mentioned trait.

We create a trait object by specifying some sort of pointer, such as a `&` reference or a `Box<T>` 
smart pointer, then the `dyn` keyword, and then specifying the relevant trait. Below is an example.

```rust
pub trait Draw {
    fn draw(&self);
}

pub struct Screen {
    pub component: Box<dyn Draw>,
}

```

The `component` is of type `Box<dyn Draw>`, which is a trait object; itâ€™s a stand-in for any type
inside a `Box` that implements the `Draw` trait.
