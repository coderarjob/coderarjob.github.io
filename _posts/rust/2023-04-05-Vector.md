title: Rust notes - Vector, arrays and slices.

Notes on how Vector, arrays and slices relate to each other.

* Most fundamentally, `Vec` is and always will be a (pointer, capacity, length) triplet. 
* The order of these fields is completely unspecified, and you should use the appropriate methods to 
  modify these.
* The pointer will never be null, so this type is null-pointer-optimized.

## Vector creation

```rust
// Using Vec::new
let v: Vec<i32> = Vec::new();

// Using vec! macro
let v: Vec<i32> = vec![];
let v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let v = vec![0; 10]; // ten zeroes

// Using Vec::from
let vec2 = Vec::from([1, 2, 3, 4]);
```

## Vector Indexing

The `Vec` type allows to access values by index, because it implements the `Index` trait.

```rust
let v = vec![0, 2, 4, 6];
println!("{}", v[1]); // it will display '2'
println!("{}", v[6]); // it will panic!
```

## Slicing

A `Vec` can be mutable. On the other hand, `slices` are read-only objects. To get a slice, use `&`.

In Rust, itâ€™s more common to pass slices as arguments rather than vectors when you just want to 
provide read access. The same goes for `String` and `&str`.

```rust
fn read_slice(slice: &[usize]) {
    // ...
}

let v = vec![0, 1];
read_slice(&v[..]);     // Correct. Type is `&[usize]`
read_slice(&v);         // No error is thrown, but this is Wrong. Type is `&alloc::vec::Vec<usize>.
```

## Vectors and arrays.

There are two different types and once does not coerces to the other.

```rust
 let array = [7, 1, 2, 3];
 let m:Vec<i32> = array;        // Type mismatch error.
```

However, many times in the rustup documentation you will see `assert_eq` that matches a vector and 
an array. I think this macro is actually matching the memory layout, but matching individual 
elements.

```rust
 let vec = vec! [7, 1, 2, 3];
 let array = [7, 1, 2, 3];
 assert_eq (vec, array);    // There is no type mismatch error and this assertiong passes.
```
